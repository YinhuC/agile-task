              If you're not completely satisfied with Agile Tasker Standard or
              Premium, you can downgrade at any moment. Upon downgrading, your
              team retains its Standard or Premium features and unlimited boards
              until the conclusion of the prepaid service period. After this
              period, it transitions into a free Agile Tasker Workspace capable
              of holding up to 10 boards. For further details on canceling your
              Standard or Premium subscription, please refer to our guidelines.

              Tasker Standard or Premium. Any Guest who is on more than one

              members. For further details on Multi-Board Guests, refer to this
